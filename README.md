# 🧠 Neural Network Visualizer

🚀 [Live Demo](https://annvisualizer.netlify.app/)

## 📌 Overview

**Neural Network Visualizer** is an interactive educational tool that demonstrates how the **Backpropagation Algorithm** works in training a simple feedforward artificial neural network. 

This project visually walks you through the **forward pass** and **backward pass** of a neural network, showing how weights and biases are updated using the error gradients to minimize the loss. It's designed to help learners understand the intuition behind neural networks and backpropagation in a clear and dynamic way.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🔢 **Customizable Input Nodes** – Choose how many input features you want (up to 3).
- 🧱 **Flexible Hidden Layers** – Add/remove hidden layers with adjustable node counts.
- 🎯 **Target Value and Learning Rate Control** – Adjust your desired output (Y) and tweak learning rate.
- 📉 **Loss Tracking** – Watch the loss reduce across epochs.
- 🔁 **Step-by-Step Backpropagation Animation** – See the learning happen live!
- 📊 **Live Graph** – Real-time chart of the loss over training epochs with classification (`Underfit`, `Best fit`, `Overfit`).
- ⚡ Built with **React**, **D3.js**, and ❤️.
